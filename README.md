<h4>A clone of Wizzair.com's website.</h4>
<p>Created a responsive, almost identical website using media queries, max-widths, and flexbox to produce tablet-friendly, visually appealing views on most screen widths and resolutions</p>

#TODO

1. The app is not fully mobile optimized yet. Once the screen size dips below say, 500 pixels, some of the sections donâ€™t look as great.

2. Implement functionality for the hamburger menu of the navbar when it appears.

4. Breakout out some of the larger component files into smaller components to become more easily tested, changed, and re-used.

3. Refactor the code to reduce repetition. Use a compiled CSS language to reduce much of the CSS repetition.
